About the Projects:

**WoWController**:
An attempt to recreate the functionality and feel of the 3rd person camera in WoW utilizing a spline-based positioning rig on top of a customized input system.

**Volumetric Reverb FPS Demo**:
Based on methods observed in David Sirland's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kaYec34gog.
This project's primary focus was to create a real-time dynamic Reverb effect which would adapt dynamically to 
changes in players location with regards to surrounding geometry without the need to pre-bake or assign reverb zones in Unity.
Also had some fun adding a customizable bullet spray system for a more CS:GO kind of feel, as well as played with some faux-physics to give raycast projectiles a bit more oomph.

**MultiAuraDrifing**:
late-night joke among friends gone too far, hacked-in functionality for a LUA addon to turn speed-boosting abilities into initial-D memes. A video for those who dont want to go through the install process just for a cheap laugh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEKgkLbwTM

**Combat System**:
A catch all project revolving around the concept a a Wold of Warcraft style combat system where abilities can be prcedurally generated or customized quickly by users with the end goal being a sort of game-designers playground iterating quickly through combat system changes and balancing. Heavy use of custom editor scripting to make customizations easy and self-explanitory.

Included is a custom spline system (based on @FreyaHolmer's 2015 Unite presentation) for animating projectile behavior using animation curves with special attention to the game-design principles outlined in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXLH0nkgkbc (jump to the 2min mark if you just want the quick and dirty)

Very much a work in progress but feel free to download and play around.
