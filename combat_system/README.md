# Combat System

A catch all project revolving around the concept a a Wold of Warcraft style combat system where abilities can be prcedurally generated or customized quickly by users with the end goal being a sort of game-designers playground iterating quickly through combat system changes and balancing. Heavy use of custom editor scripting to make customizations easy and self-explanitory.

Included is a custom spline system (based on @FreyaHolmer's 2015 Unite presentation) for animating projectile behavior using animation curves with special attention to the game-design principles outlined in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXLH0nkgkbc (jump to the 2min mark if you just want the quick and dirty)

Very much a work in progress but feel free to download and play around.

Custom spline-based particle animation system featuring animation curve driven behaviors.  
Custom editor scripting for designer tools
Syntax highlighted Combat logging and debugging
Customizable abilities, characters, faction allignments and tons more
goal is to combine this with the input system and controller projects next.
